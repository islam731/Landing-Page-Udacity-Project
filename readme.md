#The Landing Project!
>The project is about minipulating the dom and i have learn TONS of new information !!! this has gotta be the most informative part of a course!
I have added a Responsive Navigation Bar and i learnt how active class works and highlighting

## Table of Contents
* Responsive Navigation Bar , you can click it to go to a specific section , and you can tell what section you are at.
* I tried to use 100% Javascript but i run into some stuff that needed css so i used a little css
* It's Responsive , easy to use , pretty.
